What is MineColonies? Here, we would like to give you an overview of what our mod is. 

Creativity 
MineColonies is a town building mod that allows you create your own thriving Colony within Minecraft. It tends to depict a real-life scenario by providing you with different tools in your chest to aid your gaming experience. Featuring many NPC workers such as Builders, Crafters, Farmers, Guards, Enchanters and Alchemists, MineColonies provides the ability to create a rich and unique Colony. 


Governance 
In MineColonies, you take control of what goes on in your Colony. Have an adequate number of villagers who will live in the town with you. Create a division of labour, hire workers to help in developing the Colony while you maturely act as a Supervisor. 


Security and Replenishment
The growth and safety of the colony solely depends on your governmental skills. Barbarians attack the colony on few nights. Hire guards, assign them weapons and armour to aid in protecting the Colony. 
As a Colony owner, you cannot let your villagers go hungry. You can always get food from your chest to feed the hungry villagers. 


Have fun, Play with Friends 
Taking a dive into our multiplayer system is a good way to learn more about Colony building and management. A robust permission system in multi-player allows you to collaborate in a single Colony with your friends, or have individual colonies all competing to be the best!
